    here, we combine the launch file from `slam_toolbox`, a node to watch
    progress on a non-zero map while moving the Rover backwards SLOWWWWWLY, and
    Nav2 itself, waiting on the map-watcher Node to complete its work.

    let's explain a bit more about why...

    before making these changes, our Nodes all launched together... which is
    not okay for `Nav2`. you can see it complaining below:

    ```console

    ```

    well, run `ros2 topic echo /map --once`, and we can see what caused those
    errors:

    ```yaml
    header:
      stamp:
        sec: 4
        nanosec: 0
      frame_id: map
    info:
      map_load_time:
        sec: 0
        nanosec: 0
      resolution: 0.05000000074505806
      width: 0
      height: 0
      origin:
        position:
          x: 0.3
          y: 0.0
          z: 0.0
        orientation:
          x: 0.0
          y: 0.0
          z: 0.0
          w: 1.0
    data: []
    ---
    ```

    ...do you see it? look closer:

    ```yaml
    width: 0
    height: 0
    ```

    that's a map with no size! when `slam_toolbox` launches, it makes a "blank"
    map until it can get more info about the environment. more importantly, it
    needs more information about the environment before it can assume anything.

    so, we make the Rover move before starting Nav2. that's what this file is
    about. sorry for the verbose explanation lol
